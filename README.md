This is the code repository for [Mastering AWS Lambda](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-aws-lambda?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786467690), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
AWS is recognized as one of the biggest market leaders for cloud computing and why not? It has evolved a lot since the time it started out by providing just basic services such as EC2 and S3 and today; they go all the way from IoT to Machine Learning, Image recognition, Chatbot Frameworks, and much more! One of those recent services that is also gaining a lot of traction is AWS Lambda! Although seemingly simple and easy to use, Lambda is a highly effective and scalable compute service that provides developers with a powerful platform to design and develop Serverless event-driven systems and applications.

The book begins with a high-level introduction into the world of Serverless computing and its advantages and use cases, followed by a deep dive into AWS Lambda! Youâ€™ll learn what services AWS Lambda provides to developers; how to design, write, and test Lambda functions; as well as monitor and troubleshoot them. The book is designed and accompanied with a vast variety of real-world examples, use cases, and code samples that will enable you to get started on your Serverless applications quickly.

By the end of the book, you will have gained all the skills required to work with AWS Lambda services!

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter03.

Chapter 4 is zipped as it contains too many files

The code will look like the following:
```
myLambda.handler(event, context, function (err, value) {
  retError = err ;
  retValue = value ;
  done();
});
```
